Task Manager shows you **now**. Sysrewind shows you **then**.

Sysrewind runs quietly in the system tray, takes a snapshot of your system every 5 seconds, and keeps the history on your own disk.
When something felt slow — a game stuttered, the fan went wild, a meeting froze — open Sysrewind, pick the time, and see exactly what was going on and which app caused it.

> **Heavily inspired by [Grafana](https://grafana.com) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).**
> They are the tools of choice for watching servers. Sysrewind brings the same idea — record everything, explore any time range later — to a normal Windows PC, with zero setup.

## Features

- **History, not just live numbers.** CPU, RAM, disk, GPU, network and temperatures, kept for 7 to 365 days.
- **Which app did it.** Per-app CPU, RAM, disk and GPU usage, with real app icons. All of Chrome's processes count as one Chrome.
- **Plain-language insights.** *"Heavy load for 7 min. CPU peaked at 87%, mostly ffmpeg (61%)."* Sysrewind finds periods of high CPU, nearly full RAM, busy disk and high temperature on its own.
- **Drag to investigate.** Select any part of the chart to see the busiest apps in that window.
- **Temperatures that just work.** CPU (Intel and AMD Ryzen) and disk temperatures out of the box, plus NVIDIA GPUs.
- **Tiny and private.** ~5 MB installer, about 10–30 MB of RAM in the background. No account, no cloud, no telemetry — your data never leaves your PC.
- **English and Vietnamese.** Dark and light themes.

## Install

Get the file for your system from the **[latest release](../../releases/latest)**:

| System | File | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows 10/11** (recommended) | `Sysrewind_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe` | Run it, click **Yes** when Windows asks for permission. Done. |
| Windows (IT / Group Policy) | `Sysrewind_x.y.z_x64_en-US.msi` | Same app as an MSI package, for silent or managed installs: `msiexec /i Sysrewind_x.y.z_x64_en-US.msi /qn` |
| **macOS 11+** (Apple Silicon & Intel) | `Sysrewind_x.y.z_universal.dmg` | Open the DMG, drag Sysrewind to Applications. |
| **Debian / Ubuntu / Mint** | `Sysrewind_x.y.z_amd64.deb` | `sudo apt install ./Sysrewind_x.y.z_amd64.deb` |
| **Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE** | `Sysrewind-x.y.z-1.x86_64.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./Sysrewind-x.y.z-1.x86_64.rpm` |
| **Any Linux** | `Sysrewind_x.y.z_amd64.AppImage` | `chmod +x Sysrewind_*.AppImage` then run it |

Sysrewind opens, starts recording, and starts automatically when you log in.
Close the window any time — it keeps recording in the system tray / menu bar. To quit completely, use the tray icon → **Quit**.

> **Windows: "Windows protected your PC"?** The installer is not code-signed yet, so SmartScreen may warn about a new app.
> Click **More info → Run anyway**. You can compare the file's SHA-256 with the one listed on the release page.
>
> **macOS: "Sysrewind is damaged" or "can't be opened"?** The app is not notarized yet. After moving it to Applications, run once:
> `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sysrewind.app`

Windows is where Sysrewind is developed and tested most. Linux and macOS builds are new — please [report anything odd](../../issues).

## How to use it

| I want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| See what happened in the last hour | Open Sysrewind — **Overview** shows the last hour by default |
| Look at yesterday afternoon | **Custom** → pick *from* and *to* → **Apply** |
| Find out why it was slow | Check **Insights**, then click **View period** |
| See which app was heavy at a moment | Drag across the chart; the table below updates |
| Follow one app over time | **Apps** → click the app |
| Change history length or pause | **Settings** |

## FAQ

**Why does the installer need administrator rights?**
Only for temperatures. Windows doesn't let normal apps read CPU temperature. The installer adds the signed, open-source [PawnIO](https://pawnio.eu) driver (the one LibreHardwareMonitor uses) and a small background task that reads temperatures. You are asked **once**, at install time. The Sysrewind window itself never runs as administrator.

**Is it safe?**
The code is open — read it, build it yourself, or check [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for exactly what runs with elevated rights and how it is locked down.

**Does it slow my PC down?**
No. The background recorder uses about 10 MB of RAM and well under 1% CPU. The window is fully closed (not just hidden) when you close it.

**Where is my data? How big does it get?**
In `%APPDATA%\com.sysrewind.app\metrics.db`. Roughly 4–5 MB per day the PC is on (about 400 MB for the default 90 days; choose 30 days in Settings to keep it near 150 MB). Old data is deleted automatically after the period you choose (90 days by default).

**No temperature showing?**
See **Settings → Temperature**. Most often the installer's permission prompt was declined — reinstall and click **Yes**. Some CPUs (older AMD, non-Ryzen) and non-NVIDIA GPUs are not supported yet.

**How do I uninstall?**
*Settings → Apps → Installed apps → Sysrewind → Uninstall*. This removes the app, the background task and the temperature data. The PawnIO driver is left in place because other hardware tools may use it; uninstall it separately if you don't need it.

## Similar projects

Sysrewind is not the only tool in this space, and that's good. Pick what fits you:

- **[HardwareVisualizer](https://github.com/shm11C3/HardwareVisualizer)** — cross-platform hardware monitor with history and rich dashboards (Tauri, GPL-3.0).
- **[LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor)** — the reference for live sensor readings on Windows.
- **[Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud)** and **Grafana + Prometheus** — powerful monitoring stacks, built mainly for servers.

Sysrewind focuses on one thing: *answering "what happened on my PC, and why?" for anyone, with zero setup.*

## Build from source

Prerequisites: [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools.

```sh
npm install
powershell -File scripts/fetch-pawnio.ps1   # downloads and verifies the signed PawnIO installer
npm run tauri dev                           # run with hot reload
npm run tauri build                         # installer in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis
```

Tests and lint: `cd src-tauri && cargo test --lib && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

| Part | Tech |
|---|---|
| App shell | [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) — Rust + the system WebView2 |
| Metrics | [sysinfo](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/sysinfo) + Windows performance counters (GPU engines, physical disk) |
| Temperatures | PawnIO (Intel MSR / AMD SMN) and SMART in an elevated helper, NVIDIA NVML, LibreHardwareMonitor if running |
| Storage | SQLite — one row per 5 s for the system, per-minute averages for the busiest apps |
| UI | Vanilla JS + [uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot), Geist font |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Smaller history: roll old 5-second samples up into 1-minute averages
- [ ] Alerts (e.g. "RAM above 90% for 5 minutes")
- [ ] CSV export
- [ ] Per-core temperatures, AMD and Intel GPU temperatures
- [ ] Code-signed installer, notarized macOS app, auto-update
- [ ] GPU usage and app icons on Linux and macOS

## Tiếng Việt

**Sysrewind** — "tua lại" máy tính của bạn.

Phần mềm nhỏ chạy ngầm trên Windows, ghi lại CPU, RAM, ổ đĩa, GPU, mạng và nhiệt độ mỗi 5 giây. Khi máy bị lag, mở Sysrewind ra, chọn đúng lúc đó và xem **app nào gây ra**, giải thích bằng lời dễ hiểu.
Ý tưởng lấy cảm hứng lớn từ **Grafana** và **Prometheus** — nhưng dành cho máy tính cá nhân, không cần cài đặt phức tạp.

**Cài đặt:**

1. Vào mục [Releases](../../releases/latest), tải file theo hệ điều hành:
   - **Windows:** `Sysrewind_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe` → mở file, bấm **Yes** khi Windows hỏi quyền (chỉ hỏi 1 lần, để đọc nhiệt độ).
   - **macOS:** file `.dmg` → kéo Sysrewind vào Applications.
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** file `.deb` → `sudo apt install ./Sysrewind_x.y.z_amd64.deb`. Linux khác: `.rpm` hoặc `.AppImage`.
2. Xong. Sysrewind tự ghi và tự chạy khi bật máy.

Nếu Windows hiện *"Windows protected your PC"*: bấm **More info → Run anyway** (do bộ cài chưa có chữ ký số).
Nếu macOS báo app *"bị hỏng"*: chạy `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Sysrewind.app` một lần.

**Tính năng chính:** lịch sử 7–365 ngày · biết app nào dùng nhiều tài nguyên lúc nào · mục *Nhận định* tự tìm lúc máy chạy nặng, RAM đầy, máy nóng · nhiệt độ CPU và ổ đĩa có sẵn · dữ liệu chỉ nằm trên máy bạn.
