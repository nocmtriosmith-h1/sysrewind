## Reporting a bug

Open an issue with the **Bug report** template. Please include:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Set up the tools: [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+, Visual Studio C++ Build Tools.
3. Run:

   ```sh
   npm install
   powershell -File scripts/fetch-pawnio.ps1

   cd src-tauri
   cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --lib
   ```

5. Keep pull requests small and focused, and describe *why* the change is needed.
